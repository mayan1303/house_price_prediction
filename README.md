# House Price Prediction using Multiple Regression Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting house prices using multiple regression algorithms in Python.
It is designed as a learning oriented, end to end machine learning project where different regression techniques are implemented, evaluated, and compared as the learning progresses.

The repository will be continuously updated as more machine learning algorithms are learned and applied.

## Dataset

The California Housing Dataset from scikit learn is used in this project.
It contains information related to housing features such as location, population, income levels, and their corresponding median house prices.

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Train test split
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Model training using different regression algorithms
5. Cross validation for performance evaluation
6. Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error and R2 Score
7. Residual analysis using data visualization
8. Comparison of model performance

## Models Implemented

The following regression models are implemented or planned in this project:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression (upcoming)
- ElasticNet Regression (upcoming)

Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook for clarity and comparison.

---

## Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error
- R2 Score

These metrics are used to compare how different regression algorithms perform on the same dataset and how regularization impacts the model.

---

## Visualization

Residual distribution plots and other visualizations are used to:
- Analyze model assumptions
- Understand error distribution
- Evaluate overall model performance

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Future Scope

- Add advanced regression algorithms
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering for better performance
- Compare multiple models side by side
- Extend the project towards more advanced machine learning techniques
