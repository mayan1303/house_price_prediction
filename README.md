# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a house price prediction model using Linear Regression in Python.  
The goal is to understand the complete machine learning workflow starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Dataset
California Housing Dataset from scikit learn is used in this project.  
It contains information related to housing features and their corresponding median house prices.

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Train test split
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Cross validation for performance evaluation
6. Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error and R2 score
7. Residual analysis using data visualization

## Technologies Used
Python  
NumPy  
Pandas  
Scikit learn  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  

## Model Evaluation
Mean Squared Error was calculated using cross validation.  
R2 Score on test data is approximately 0.59 which indicates a reasonable model fit.

## Visualization
Residual distribution plot is used to analyze the assumptions of Linear Regression and model performance.

## Conclusion
The model successfully captures the relationship between housing features and prices.  
Further improvements can be made using advanced regression techniques and feature engineering.
